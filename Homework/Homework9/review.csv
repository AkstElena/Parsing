This experience was not the best demonstration of a streamlined or very efficient process in expediting fast food.

The order I was waiting on took a whooping 15 minutes and was given to someone else without an apology. That being said, I would have rated them with 1 star but I decided to walk in and watch the process.
The customer service was what I would expect given the employees having to deal with the distractions from the crowd of people inquiring about their order.

* Customers can look up at the monitors above the counter to see the process of their order.

The average gluttonous ""starving"" American that eats at McDonald's behaves as though their needs are of paramount importance. It's one of the best examples you can witness of bloated self-entitlement.
McDonald's employees, you are doing a good job and on behalf of the Jerry Springer audience members that eat at your restaurant. Please forgive them.",5 stars

1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal.

I opened my quarter pounder hamburger and it was turned upside down with all of the toppings splattered onto the box as if it was slapped in there. It literally had no top hamburger bun, and when I brought this up to the cashier she said that this is what a ""quarter hamburger"" was. When I asked for just a top hamburger bun at least and showed the cashier the burger she didn't even apologize or offer to remake the burger she just snatched the box out of my hands. I paid for this burger and was only asking for the bun, not making a scene or demanding anything or being rude. I had chosen to not acknowledge the mess it was because there are enough verbally abusive patrons. But all the cashier ended up doing was turn the burger right side up (no gloves) and slap an undercooked bun on it, and yell at the other adult woman at the grill about ""what's missing here?"". It wasn't even busy in the drive thru or the dining room. I can't pretend to know their job or lives, but I hope they aren't this effed up to every PAYING customer. I ended up asking for a refund, and not taking the burger, even this was an issue. Please beware!! I only regret not getting their names to report them.
